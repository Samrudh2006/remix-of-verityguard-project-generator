## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Role-based access control** using a permission system provides flexibility for future feature additions
2. **Shared dashboard layout** reduces code duplication and ensures consistency
3. **Protected routes** at the routing level provide security by default
4. **Custom hooks** make permission checking reusable across components
5. **LocalStorage** for demo purposes allows easy testing without backend

### Best Practices Applied
- Component composition over inheritance
- Single responsibility principle
- Consistent naming conventions
- Responsive-first design
- Accessibility considerations
- Performance optimization (code splitting ready)

---

## 🤝 Contributing

To add new features or improve existing ones:

1. Follow the established component structure
2. Use the permission system for access control
3. Maintain consistent styling with Tailwind CSS
4. Test across all roles
5. Update relevant documentation

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations (Demo Version)
1. **Data Storage**: Uses localStorage (max 10 users, no persistence across devices)
2. **No Backend**: All data is mock/static
3. **No Real-time Updates**: Dashboard stats are static
4. **Limited Error Handling**: Basic validation only
5. **No Image Uploads**: Media library is UI-only

### Planned Fixes
- Integrate with backend API for persistent storage
- Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
- Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Implement actual file upload functionality
- Add data validation and sanitization
